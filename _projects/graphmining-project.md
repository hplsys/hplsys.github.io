Graph mining tasks retrieve information from graph-structured data. It is widely used in various areas like social network analysis, cybersecurity, bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, protein function prediction, etc. As the problem is NP-hard, it always becomes a performance bottleneck in these areas particularly when dealing with exceedingly large graph datasets. Due to that, extensive research has been dedicated to developing efficient graph mining algorithms and systems over many years. Our laboratory is committed to developing a cutting-edge graph mining system that sets the global benchmark for performance.

Graph mining includes the following tasks: Graph Pattern Matching, Frequent Subgraph Mining, Subgraph Counting, Motif Counting, K-clique Counting, etc. These tasks either find all the subgraphs in the input graph that are isomorphic to a given pattern(Graph Pattern Matching, Motif Counting, K-clique Counting) or identify the most frequently appeared patterns throughout the input graph (Frequent Subgraph Mining, Subgraph Counting). The problem has some variations, like the scenarios when the graph is dynamic or temporal.
